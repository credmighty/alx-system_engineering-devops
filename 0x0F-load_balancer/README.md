 Concepts
 For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

- Load balancer
	- [Load-balancing](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2016/01/load-balancer-intro/)
	- [Load-balancing algorithms](https://community.f5.com/kb/technicalarticles/intro-to-load-balancing-for-developers-%E2%80%93-the-algorithms/273759)
- [Web stack debugging](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VwAWffCYnKEYNvoHoRUM-cEgs_ooGLCC69fgnsPUrEI/edit?usp=sharing)

Background Context
You have been given 2 additional servers:

gc-[STUDENT_ID]-web-02-XXXXXXXXXX
gc-[STUDENT_ID]-lb-01-XXXXXXXXXX
Let’s improve our web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers. This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers, and to make our infrastructure more reliable. If one web server fails, we will still have a second one to handle requests.

For this project, you will need to write Bash scripts to automate your work. All scripts must be designed to configure a brand new Ubuntu server to match the task requirements.

Resources
Read or watch:

- [Introduction to load-balancing and HAproxy](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-haproxy-and-load-balancing-concepts)
- [HTTP header](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/27178/http-header)
- [Debian/Ubuntu HAProxy packages](https://haproxy.debian.net/)

Requirements
============

General
-------
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All your Bash script files must be executable
Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7) without any error
The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
Your servers
Name	Username	IP	State	
115385-web-01	ubuntu	52.91.134.62	running	
115385-web-02	ubuntu	54.164.95.199	running	
115385-lb-01	ubuntu  54.160.103.240  running			
Tasks
0. Double the number of webservers
mandatory
In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01. Fortunately, you built a Bash script during your web server project, and they’ll now come in handy to easily configure web-02. Remember, always try to automate your work!

Since we’re placing our web servers behind a load balancer for this project, we want to add a custom Nginx response header. The goal here is to be able to track which web server is answering our HTTP requests, to understand and track the way a load balancer works. More in the coming tasks.

Requirements:

Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on web-01 and web-02)
The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 0-custom_http_response_header so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
Ignore SC2154 for shellcheck
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 34.198.248.145 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 03-web-01
sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -sI 54.89.38.100 | grep X-Served-By
X-Served-By: 03-web-02
sylvain@ubuntu$
If your server’s hostnames are not properly configured ([STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02.), follow this [tutorial](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/linux-static-hostname).

Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
Directory: 0x0F-load_balancer
File: 0-custom_http_response_header
  
1. Install your load balancer
mandatory
Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.

Requirements:

Configure HAproxy so that it send traffic to web-01 and web-02
Distribute requests using a roundrobin algorithm
Make sure that HAproxy can be managed via an init script
Make sure that your servers are configured with the right hostnames: [STUDENT_ID]-web-01 and [STUDENT_ID]-web-02. If not, follow this [tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-hostname.html).
For your answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ curl -Is 54.210.47.110
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.4.6 (Ubuntu)

2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet
#advanced
Just as in task #0, we’d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.

The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
Repo:

GitHub repository: alx-system_engineering-devops
Directory: 0x0F-load_balancer
File: 2-puppet_custom_http_response_header.pp
